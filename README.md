## Hi there 👋Welcome to my homepage
### ✨Self-introduction
I am an undergraduate student pursuing a minor in Computer Technology and Science, currently in the 2023 cohort at Fuzhou University.

### 😄Personality-wise
I am a meticulous individual filled with curiosity, always harboring a passion for exploring the unknown. As an INFJ, I am fond of letting data speak for itself, believing that in the vast realm of big data, every single number hides a valuable story waiting to be uncovered.

### 🌱Hobbies and interests
* I have a strong passion for programming and technological innovationIn my free time, I self-study programming languages, leveraging my major to cultivate interdisciplinary thinking and skills.
* Additionally, I am avid about data analysis and visualization, enjoying the process of transforming complex data into intuitive and easily comprehensible information through charts and models. This allows me to gain a deeper understanding of mathematical models. 

### 🫵Ability assessment
1. 当前的技能树与技术偏好：
* 目前我掌握了Microsoft Office系列软件中的SQL语言和内置编程语言VBA，用于处理简单的数据库操作与自动化任务，其他从0开始；
2. 目前的代码量以及希望达到的代码量：
* 我是一名辅修计科的大二商科学生，目前正在自学Python；
* 我希望能够有百行左右的代码量，掌握至少一种主流开发框架，将代码量提升至能够辅助团队完成小型软件开发项目的水平。
3. 你对哪类技术方向有兴趣，最想学习哪些方面的知识：
* 我希望具备一定的编程能力；
* 在软件开发的整个生命周期中培养各种学科意识，了解软件开放过程。
  
### 🎯Academic aspirations and practical goals
* While I may not have any hands-on experience in academia or practice yet, I am fully committed to putting in the effort! During my second year at university, I will be delving into numerous compulsory courses within my major, and I am hopeful that these studies will further enhance my skills and enable me to apply them in real-world projects. 
* Specifically, I envision embarking on a big data statistical analysis project, where I will collect and analyze data to provide insights and recommendations for businesses to improve their marketing strategies. I am excited about this opportunity to bridge theory and practice.
  
### 🔭Planning for the next three years 
* I look forward to continuing to deepen my knowledge of big data in my future studies and career, applying what I've learned to solve practical problems, and simultaneously exploring and innovating within this field.
* After graduating from university, I aspire to enter the workforce directly. However, given the current economic downturn, I recognize the importance of enhancing my capabilities during this period of oversupply in the job market. My goal is to make myself a competitive candidate and successfully secure a position in a reputable company.
